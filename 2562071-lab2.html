            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Vusthila Mashimbyi, and I am currently in my final year of studying Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
                Over the course of my degree, I have developed a strong interest in areas such as software development, artificial intelligence, and data analysis. 
                I've worked on several projects involving languages like Java, JavaScript, C++, and a bit of Python with frameworks like React. 
                And I’m passionate about solving complex problems through code. I enjoy collaborating with peers to tackle challenges, and I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. 
                As I approach graduation, I am looking forward to exploring career opportunities where I can continue to grow and contribute to innovative tech solutions.</p>

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The last project I worked on was a website for my dad’s construction company. The goal was to create a clean, modern portfolio that showcases his company's past and ongoing projects. I built a dynamic project gallery where visitors can explore detailed information about each project, view high-quality images, and easily navigate through the gallery with interactive thumbnails and navigation arrows.
                    The website is fully responsive, making it easy to browse on both desktop and mobile devices. I focused on creating a user-friendly experience with clear project categories and status updates, helping potential clients and partners get a comprehensive view of my dad’s work.
                    This project was a great opportunity for me to apply my web development skills and create something that truly represents my dad’s business.
